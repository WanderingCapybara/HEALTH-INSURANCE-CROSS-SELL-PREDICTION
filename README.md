# HEALTH INSURANCE CROSS SELL PREDICTION

## Background

The client, an insurance company, wants to create a model to forecast if their previous year's health insurance policyholders would also be inclined to buy vehicle insurance. Insurance policies provide compensation for specified losses or damages in exchange for regular premium payments. The premiums help cover potential costs, and the concept relies on probabilities to distribute risk among policyholders. The company wants to use demographic and policy-related information, such as age, gender, region, vehicle details, and premium amounts, to predict customer interest in vehicle insurance. This prediction will aid the company in tailoring communication strategies and optimizing its revenue.
